This is a chrome extension. 
Unload it and test it out on your personal laptop. 

Navigate to a Youtube Video Page, and open the bookmark extension. 
You can add bookmarks to your YouTube Video, and even delete them. 
I have used chrome tabs API to interact with the youtube buttons through my contentScript.js file!
